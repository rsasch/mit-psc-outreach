Participants are encouraged to return for a second summer of flexible length devoted to the development of lesson plans and classroom material that can be shared with other science teachers.','This program provides middle & high school science teachers with an opportunity to participate in exciting, cutting-edge research at MIT.','Participants are expected to work in the lab full-time for seven weeks (late June-early August) the first summer.

Teachers/classrooms and fishermen work together to create a partnership that fits their individual classroom goals. By partnering with classrooms, fishermen help educate students about marine ecology, the complexities of marine resource utilization, and the daily life of fishermen. Conceptualized and organized by New England fishermen, the MIT Sea Grant College Program and other cooperating organization, Adopt-a-Boat works to present a balanced picture of commercial fishing, thereby building a citizenry enlightened about marine resources and the importance of coastal communities. Partnerships have included classroom visits by fishermen, overnight trips on fishing vessels, tours of vessels, and introductions to fishing gear and equipment.','The Adopt-a-Boat program facilitates educational partnerships between fishermen and K-12 classrooms throughout New England.','Please contact the program coordinator to set up your partnership today.
